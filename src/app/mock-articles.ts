      "<p>Hello All,</p><p>I’m Banerjee. I Code for change and do it cause it is the only thing i believe i can do!</p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum",

      " So I hang myself today. The rope around my neck will finally snap my head and choke my breath. At least it's the best I could ever do. I remember now memories forcing back my thoughts but the fact remains still even in the raging winds of my mind. It looks like there could be another choice, a hope perhaps to change the present and maybe find a fault with my endeavor. My paranoid self forced me to live in with the ever changing theme of this world and now it's guilt that makes up the background of my mind. I infact carry  logic and reasoning with equal thought and now even when both of them are hanging on a barbed wire I find my adrenaline rush the better option among the few choices. I make my condition a little more sadistic, a little optimistic and a Little psychis and I find that the very beautiful reason to live is the biggest lie and the truth of death is is the exact reason for why we continue to dig graves in midst of dreams. To reduce the effect of a person's will to live, you just have to give him options to choose, to decide and to think about the consequences of them and it will break what they withhold the most in their life. I like those who speak about life, it's joy, it's beauty and it's meaning. I find these topics rather interesting in front of the gloomy speeches about ways to prevent suicidal thoughts. These topics gives us a viewpoint of what's ahead of us making us feel sober by the end of the day and the endless craze for it drives you into a utter dystopia making the miracle cure rush into your mind like a imperative order from heaven and it barely needs any psychological resistance to even check out with the reality. The time waits for its own purpose steering sheeps in search of green maidens. All I can say that when these ropes sanp open your spinal cord and choke your body, it will seem like a foolish decision at first but in the grasp of pain as your lights grow dimmer and the world finally bows out to your act, it will finally make sense to logic why it never could take the place of magic. The world crumbles below the belief of a better life as one disappears among the crowded heaven. The reasoning to every action is a measure made by the society to cover the stain with a painkiller. You may pull away from the horizon and try to make sense in the open sky but the synonym to our lives had never been created. The deserted roads and the travellers walking are just pitiful of their own companions. Sympathy had lost the way with mercy following it's trail long before your ego made place in this world. Now at the end when someone tries to symphatise with a dead body, it feels foolish to me that he too like me is a rat that makes trap for another rat. The ending might makes deceptive conclusion but who cares when you now feel you know that  you will be 'AT REST'. Even fading into time is an optimistic thinking and now that you are sure you will never be inside a troubled heart and a restless mind seeking your life as their inspiration..<p>Akash Biswas</p>",
